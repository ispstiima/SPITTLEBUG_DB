# Dataset: SPITTLEBUG_DB
This dataset was created to support the publication of the accompanying brief article and to make the data publicly available. It contains 365 images in .PNG and .JPG formats, captured at various resolutions using three different devices: an Intel RealSense D435, a Canon EOS1100D, and an iPhone 11. The images are intended for research in computer vision and machine learning, particularly for applications in pest monitoring and automated detection systems.

## Subject Area
- **Computer science**: artificial intelligence, computer vision, computer science applications, pattern recognition  
- **Data science**: applied machine learning
